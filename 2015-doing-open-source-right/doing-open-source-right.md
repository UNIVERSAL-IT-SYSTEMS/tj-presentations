> To go fast, go alone.  To go far, go together.<br>
  - African proverb

NOTE: One of my favorite quotes, and really captures the essence of what open source is about.

---

## Why Open Source?

- Share useful code, hints, ideas
- Collaborate
- Build community
- Recruiting
- Build your resume

---

## Is throwing your code on
## github.com open source?

---

## Open Source can be hard

- Often times side projects not sponsored by companies
- Almost all your collaborators will be remote
- Difficult to get commitment and deadlines
- Some folks will steal your code and not give you credit

---

## Open Source can be very rewarding

- Building community and relationships
- Giving back to the tech community
- Direct engagement with users of your software
- Helps recruiting efforts - especially with top developers
- Github account is the new resume

NOTE: lots of folks have told me they found my blog posts etc.

## A note on OSS and Recruiting

- Conference talks are a great way to advertise your company
- Why need tech screens and code challenges?
    + Code already on github
    + Can see how someone interacts with community, treats others
- Collaboration: getting others to work on your projects without hiring them

## github.com/spark-jobserver/spark-jobserver

- REST API for Spark jobs, Scala / Akka / Spray
- Developed by my team at Ooyala
- Open sourced at Spark Summit 2013
- Steady stream of outside contributors, many different areas including UI

---

## Open Collaboration

- Open code reviews
    + Github PRs
- Open project management
    + Github issue tracker / milestones
    + Atlassian, let others sign up
- Have a decent README and Wiki
- Invite outside committers

NOTE: outside committers - good reward for those who show commitment

---

## Open Community

- Blog posts
- Conference talks
- Google groups
    + Github Issues is NOT a good Q&A forum
- IRC / Gitter / etc.
- Stack Overflow

---

## Barriers to giving talks

- I don't have time
- I'm not an expert
- I hate public speaking
- I'd rather be coding

---

## Talk ideas

- Use cases.  "How we use PostGresQL"
    + Most people are especially interested to hear about production use cases, problems on new technology
    + Most people need help choosing X vs Y
    + You don't need solutions, it's OK to point out problems and have a conversation
- What you're working on right now, challenges
- Performance tuning X
- How to's -- "Secrets of Dockerizing Microservices"

---

## Great Blog Post ideas

- What challenging things are you working on?
- Can be extremely small and short - how to use one feature of your favorite language / tool
- Announcing new OSS projects
- "Why we value XXX as a company" - culture posts

---

## Quality over Quantity

Having a few OSS projects with deep community involvement is usually much more beneficial than 100 OSS projects just thrown out there.
